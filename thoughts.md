# Lemonaid Feature Ideas

## "Return to most recent" shortcut

When jumping from the lma inbox to a Claude session, sometimes you feel lost and want to go back to where you were.

Possible approaches:
- Track the "last location" before switching (workspace + pane)
- Add a keybinding like `b` (back) that returns to that location
- Could store this in the notification metadata or as app state
- Maybe a stack of recent locations for multi-level back?

Status: Stray thought, may or may not be worth pursuing.
